    "content": "# A Risk Management Analysis of Google's A2A and Anthropic's MCP\n\nHave you noticed it's been hard to keep pace with AI news lately? In this article, I examine how traditional risk frameworks apply to emerging AI technologies, with a particular focus on Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication and Anthropic's Multi-Context Planning (MCP).\n\n## The Challenge of Agent-to-Agent Communication\n\nAs AI systems become more autonomous and capable of communicating with each other, the complexity of potential interactions grows exponentially. Enterprise risk teams need to develop new approaches to manage these interactions, particularly in regulated industries.\n\nWith n agents potentially communicating, the number of potential workflows increases at a rate of n^a, where a represents the possible action paths. This creates a combinatorial explosion of possibilities that traditional testing and validation approaches cannot adequately address.\n\n## How Traditional GRC Frameworks Fall Short\n\nTraditional governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) frameworks were designed for human-to-human and human-to-machine interactions. They struggle to account for complex machine-to-machine interactions, especially when those machines possess adaptive learning capabilities.\n\nSome specific limitations include:\n\n1. **Deterministic Assumptions**: Most risk frameworks assume deterministic behavior, but AI systems often demonstrate probabilistic outcomes that change over time.\n\n2. **Static Control Points**: Traditional controls are defined at specific points in a process, but AI systems may dynamically adjust workflows in ways that bypass these control points.\n\n3. **Human Oversight Requirements**: Many compliance frameworks require meaningful human oversight, which becomes increasingly difficult when AI systems operate at machine speed and scale.\n\n## Three Practical Risk Mitigation Strategies\n\nDespite these challenges, organizations can take practical steps to manage AI risk:\n\n### 1. Implement Bounded AI Operational Environments\n\nCreate operational sandboxes with clear boundaries for AI systems. These environments should:\n- Define explicit interaction limits\n- Monitor for boundary testing behavior\n- Include automatic circuit breakers when unexpected patterns emerge\n\n### 2. Develop Dynamic Risk Assessment Capabilities\n\nMove beyond static risk assessments to continuous monitoring:\n- Deploy real-time anomaly detection across system interactions\n- Use AI to monitor AI (recursive monitoring)\n- Create early warning indicators that evolve as systems learn\n\n### 3. Establish Cross-Functional AI Governance\n\nBuild governance teams that combine technical and business expertise:\n- Include ethics specialists, legal experts, and domain specialists\n- Implement regular scenario planning for emergent risks\n- Create feedback loops between risk identification and development teams\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs AI becomes more deeply integrated into enterprise operations, risk management approaches must evolve beyond traditional frameworks. By implementing bounded operational environments, developing dynamic assessment capabilities, and establishing cross-functional governance, organizations can harness AI's benefits while managing its unique risks.\n\nOrganizations that successfully adapt their risk management approaches will be better positioned to leverage AI as a competitive advantage while maintaining appropriate safeguards.\n\n*This article represents my personal views and not those of my employer.*",
