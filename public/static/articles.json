    "content": "# A Risk Management Analysis of Google's A2A and Anthropic's MCP\n\nHave you noticed it's been hard to keep pace with AI news lately? In this article, I examine how traditional risk frameworks apply to emerging AI technologies, with a particular focus on Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication and Anthropic's Multi-Context Planning (MCP).\n\n## The Challenge of Agent-to-Agent Communication\n\nAs AI systems become more autonomous and capable of communicating with each other, the complexity of potential interactions grows exponentially. Enterprise risk teams need to develop new approaches to manage these interactions, particularly in regulated industries.\n\nWith n agents potentially communicating, the number of potential workflows increases at a rate of n^a, where a represents the possible action paths. This creates a combinatorial explosion of possibilities that traditional testing and validation approaches cannot adequately address.\n\n## How Traditional GRC Frameworks Fall Short\n\nTraditional governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) frameworks were designed for human-to-human and human-to-machine interactions. They struggle to account for complex machine-to-machine interactions, especially when those machines possess adaptive learning capabilities.\n\nSome specific limitations include:\n\n1. **Deterministic Assumptions**: Most risk frameworks assume deterministic behavior, but AI systems often demonstrate probabilistic outcomes that change over time.\n\n2. **Static Control Points**: Traditional controls are defined at specific points in a process, but AI systems may dynamically adjust workflows in ways that bypass these control points.\n\n3. **Human Oversight Requirements**: Many compliance frameworks require meaningful human oversight, which becomes increasingly difficult when AI systems operate at machine speed and scale.\n\n## Three Practical Risk Mitigation Strategies\n\nDespite these challenges, organizations can take practical steps to manage AI risk:\n\n### 1. Implement Bounded AI Operational Environments\n\nCreate operational sandboxes with clear boundaries for AI systems. These environments should:\n- Define explicit interaction limits\n- Monitor for boundary testing behavior\n- Include automatic circuit breakers when unexpected patterns emerge\n\n### 2. Develop Dynamic Risk Assessment Capabilities\n\nMove beyond static risk assessments to continuous monitoring:\n- Deploy real-time anomaly detection across system interactions\n- Use AI to monitor AI (recursive monitoring)\n- Create early warning indicators that evolve as systems learn\n\n### 3. Establish Cross-Functional AI Governance\n\nBuild governance teams that combine technical and business expertise:\n- Include ethics specialists, legal experts, and domain specialists\n- Implement regular scenario planning for emergent risks\n- Create feedback loops between risk identification and development teams\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs AI becomes more deeply integrated into enterprise operations, risk management approaches must evolve beyond traditional frameworks. By implementing bounded operational environments, developing dynamic assessment capabilities, and establishing cross-functional governance, organizations can harness AI's benefits while managing its unique risks.\n\nOrganizations that successfully adapt their risk management approaches will be better positioned to leverage AI as a competitive advantage while maintaining appropriate safeguards.\n\n*This article represents my personal views and not those of my employer.*",

    "content": "The technology landscape is changing more quickly than ever. New systems appear, dependencies shift, and team members rotate through roles. Yet many organizations treat disaster recovery planning (DRP) and business continuity planning (BCP) as periodic \"check-the-box\" exercises rather than living documents reflecting operational reality.\n\nThis creates a dangerous gap between documented plans and actual recovery capabilities.\n\nTraditional approaches suffer from annual review syndrome, documentation without testing, siloed planning, and outdated assumptions. Instead of treating DRP/BCP as periodic compliance exercises, organizations should implement a Matrix Approach with incremental reviews that keeps plans aligned with operational reality.\n\n## The Matrix Framework\n\nThe Matrix Approach classifies every recovery component across three dimensions: System Tiers (0-3 based on criticality), Process Categories (A-D based on business impact), and Personnel Functions (Essential through Deferred). This multi-dimensional view reveals recovery priorities and interdependencies that linear approaches miss.\n\nEach cell in the matrix gets its own review cadence, validation method, and ownership assignment. Monthly reviews focus on Tier 0 systems, quarterly reviews cover Tier 1 systems and Category A processes, semi-annual reviews encompass Tier 2 systems and Category B/C processes, while annual comprehensive drills validate the entire integrated system.\n\n## Key Innovations and Advantages\n\nThe Matrix Approach introduces several enhancements: recovery component heat mapping for visual prioritization, trigger-based reviews that respond to organizational changes as they happen, composite recovery teams organized by capability rather than department, and component dependency mapping.\n\nBreaking monolithic plans into sub-plans with clear ownership ensures effective maintenance—technology recovery plans, operational continuity plans, and crisis management plans each with designated owners responsible for accuracy and validation.\n\nCompared to traditional ISACA/COBIT approaches, the Matrix Approach provides better integration through its multi-dimensional view, distributes testing burden throughout the year, focuses on common recovery components rather than endless scenario planning, and creates a dynamic management system that responds to organizational changes.\n\n## LLM Integration and Implementation\n\nLarge Language Models can enhance disaster recovery planning through dynamic documentation generation, gap analysis, scenario generation, and dependency identification. However, rigorous validation is essential through domain-specific accuracy assessment, expert review, and benchmarking against standards like ISO 22301 and NIST SP 800-34.\n\nImplementation follows a phased approach: matrix development and classification, sub-plan development, initial validation, process refinement, and full integration. The framework offers a practical methodology that organizations will find easier to maintain over time while still satisfying compliance requirements.\n\nThe most elegant recovery plan is worthless if it doesn't work in practice. Through the Matrix Approach, incremental review, cross-functional ownership, and progressive live drills, organizations can close the gap between documentation and reality—building genuine resilience rather than false security.\n\n[Read the complete framework analysis on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/matrix-approach-incremental-drp-bcp-review-brian-fending) or [Substack](https://brianfending.substack.com/p/matrix-approach-incremental-drp-bcp-review) for detailed implementation guidance.",
