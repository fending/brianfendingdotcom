      "content": "I help organizations build technology programs that balance innovation with governance. My work spans IT and AI governance, enterprise security strategy, product development leadership, and board-level risk communication. Whether implementing frameworks that accelerate AI adoption without creating ungovernable risk or strengthening cybersecurity posture across multiple regulatory regimes, I partner with leadership to make technology a strategic enabler rather than an operational constraint."
