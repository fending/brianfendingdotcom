      "content": "I help organizations build technology programs that balance innovation with governance. My work spans IT and AI governance, enterprise security strategy, software development, and product lifecycle management. Whether implementing frameworks that accelerate AI adoption without creating ungovernable risk or strengthening cybersecurity posture across multiple regulatory regimes, I partner with leadership to make technology a strategic enabler rather than an operational constraint."
